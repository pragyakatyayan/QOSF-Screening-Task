I hereby submit my solution notebook for the QOSF mentorship screening task. The `Task-2.ipynb` jupyter notebook contains the solutions. The notebook can be viewed on NBviewer (click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pragyakatyayan/QOSF-Screening-Task/blob/master/Task2.ipynb)), in case the mathjax does not render properly.

I am sincerely thankful to QOSF, for giving suchh tasks which challenge us and make us push our boundaries. I personally learnt a lot while attempting this task.

With regards,  
Pragya Katyayan.
